# Welcome to the Laboratory!
## Home of The Optimizers

We are users of Resonite, a Virtual Reality (VR) game/social space/sandbox system available as standalone and on Steam (see https://resonite.com to check it out).

Resonite is a system that provides its users with extremely flexible options for building and coding.  But such flexibility comes with a cost, especially for users who are new to 3D rendering and programming: if you don't yet know how things work, then it's very likely you unknowingly make choices that can affect peformance, both for you and for other people.  We beleive that no one is born with this knowledge and that a useful way to learn about it is with a hands-on approach.  This is why we have built this lab, as a way to share knowledge, and give you the tools you need to make informed decisions about how you construct your experiences.

How you and other people experience a world in Resonite depends very much on the capabilities of your computers, and not everyone's computer is the same.  We do not suggest that a builder should build to the lowest common denominator, but rather simply consider that if you can make a choice that improves performance without sacrificing your vision, you should.

We are working to provide some hands-on tools within the game to allow users, especially ones new to building & rendering, to learn about tips & techniques to optimize the experiences they're building.  Starting with MMC24 and Lab #1, Lighting, we'll be adding more sections to the tutorial system.
